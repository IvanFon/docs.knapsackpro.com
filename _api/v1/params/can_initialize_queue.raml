  The first request from each CI nodes should set this field to `true` so the first coming request to Knapsack Pro API will initialize queue on the API side.
  
  All next requests from each CI node should set this field to `false` so thanks to that when the queue will be empty on API side then the CI nodes will know that should finish work instead of initializing another queue.
